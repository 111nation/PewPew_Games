# PewPew Game Library

```run.bat``` **(Windows)** essentially is a quick workaround to send the ```.py``` files and update the PewPew device to keep this repository and the device separate.

**Quick Note (Windows users):** To use ```run.bat ```, you MUST change the drive letter to the correct letter—the one referencing the PewPew v10.2—otherwise any ```.py``` files in the incorrect drive will get deleted!
